Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element in given Array


Given an array arr[] of integers, the task is to find the Next Greater Element 
for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.
Note: The Next Greater Element for an element x is the first greater element o
n the right side of x in the array. Elements for which no greater element exist,
 consider the next greater element as -1. 
 
 
 Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]
Explanation: The next larger element to 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 2 is 4 and for 4, since 
it doesnâ€™t exist, it is -1.
